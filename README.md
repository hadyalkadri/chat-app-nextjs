# chat-app-nextjs



A real-time chat app that uses web sockets to transfer data between two clients through socket.io library in both the client side (NextJS/ReactJS) and 
the server side (NodeJS/ExpressJS).

The web application is both mobile and desktop friendly. It consists of a login portal where you use a room to communicate back and forth with another user.
In addition to the messaging functionality, you can also send images and files with other users.

Moreover, as we are using web sockets tracing or intercepting messages between users become relatively difficult to accomplish and is exactly why such technology is
being used for this project.

This project does not employ a database. However, integrating a NoSQL database like MongoDB will not be a burden as the entire infrastructure is already laid out.
